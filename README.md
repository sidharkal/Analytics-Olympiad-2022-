About Dataset and problem:
The Vehicle Insurance business is a multi-billion dollar industry. Every year millions and millions of premiums are paid, and a huge amount of claims also pile up. 

You have to step into the shoes of a data scientist who is building models to help an insurance company understand which claims are worth rejecting and the claims which should be accepted for reimbursement. 

You are given a rich dataset consisting of thousands of rows of past records, which you can use to learn more about your customersâ€™ behaviours. For example, you are supposed to create an ML model to look at a case of an insurance claim and decide whether to reject or accept it.
